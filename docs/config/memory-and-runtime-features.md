# Memory, Compaction, And Runtime Features

This page documents the configuration that shapes Tulkun's memory-facing and
session-behavior features without explaining the underlying behavior in depth.

Use this page for:

- Active Memory configuration
- Core Memory and dreaming flags
- automatic compaction
- phero bootstrap selection

## `phero`

`phero` controls default agent selection for bootstrap-style decisions.

| Field | Type | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `phero.agent_yaml` | string | empty | Optional path to agent YAML used by phero-related flows. |
| `phero.agent_name` | string | empty; effective default agent is `main` | Default agent name for bootstrap and heartbeat-related agent selection. |

Use `phero.agent_name` when:

- you want a different default agent than `main` for bootstrap-style background flows

## `compact`

`compact` controls structured transcript compaction behavior.

| Field | Type | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compact.auto` | boolean | `true` | Enables automatic compaction behavior. |

What it controls:

- whether Tulkun may automatically compact session history under pressure

Use it when:

- long-running sessions should self-maintain continuity
- you want to disable automatic compaction and rely on manual control instead

## `memory`

The top-level `memory` block covers Active Memory and Core Memory.

It is separate from `agents.defaults.memory_*`, which controls memory-related
runtime policy such as search and governance.

### `memory.active`

`memory.active` configures Active Memory as a product feature.

| Field | Type | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory.active.enabled` | boolean | effective `true` when omitted | Entry-level switch for Active Memory. |
| `memory.active.config.enabled` | boolean | effective `true` when omitted | Nested runtime switch for Active Memory behavior. |
| `memory.active.config.agents` | string[] | effective `["main"]` | Agent IDs allowed to use Active Memory. |
| `memory.active.config.model` | string | empty | Preferred model for Active Memory runs. |
| `memory.active.config.model_fallback` | string | empty | Fallback model for Active Memory runs. |
| `memory.active.config.allowed_chat_types` | string[] | effective `["direct"]` | Allowed chat types for Active Memory use. |
| `memory.active.config.thinking` | string | empty | Reserved label field; parsed but not currently consumed by runtime decision logic. |
| `memory.active.config.query_mode` | string | `recent` | Controls how much recent conversation is included in the recall query. |
| `memory.active.config.prompt_style` | string | inferred from `query_mode`; usually `balanced` | Shapes the recall prompt style. |
| `memory.active.config.prompt_override` | string | empty | Full prompt override. |
| `memory.active.config.prompt_append` | string | empty | Suffix appended to the generated prompt. |
| `memory.active.config.timeout_ms` | integer | `15000` | Active Memory timeout in milliseconds. |
| `memory.active.config.max_summary_chars` | integer | `220` | Maximum summary size returned by Active Memory. |
| `memory.active.config.recent_user_turns` | integer | `2` | Recent user-turn window. |
| `memory.active.config.recent_assistant_turns` | integer | `1` | Recent assistant-turn window. |
| `memory.active.config.recent_user_chars` | integer | `220` | Recent user-character budget. |
| `memory.active.config.recent_assistant_chars` | integer | `180` | Recent assistant-character budget. |
| `memory.active.config.logging` | boolean | `false` | Enables Active Memory status logging. |
| `memory.active.config.cache_ttl_ms` | integer | `15000` | Cache TTL for Active Memory results. |
| `memory.active.config.persist_transcripts` | boolean | `false` | Persists transcripts used by Active Memory processing. |
| `memory.active.config.transcript_dir` | string | `active-memory` | Directory name for persisted Active Memory transcripts. |

#### How To Use Active Memory Settings

Use `agents` when:

- only some named agents should be allowed to perform recall

Use `model` and `model_fallback` when:

- you want Active Memory to use a different model from the main response model
- you want a cheaper or more stable fallback path

Use `query_mode` when:

- you want tighter or broader recall context

Accepted `query_mode` values:

- `recent`
- `message`
- `full`

Use `prompt_style` when:

- recall needs to be stricter, more contextual, or more preference-oriented

Accepted prompt styles:

- `balanced`
- `strict`
- `contextual`
- `recall-heavy`
- `precision-heavy`
- `preference-only`

Use `prompt_override` only when:

- you need full control over recall prompting
- you are willing to own the resulting behavior

Use the recent-turn and recent-char windows when:

- Active Memory is pulling too little or too much short-term context into recall

Use `persist_transcripts` when:

- you need reproducibility or inspection for Active Memory behavior

### `memory.core`

`memory.core` is the top-level Core Memory block.

| Field | Type | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory.core.enabled` | boolean | effective `true` when the entry exists and the flag is omitted | Enables the Core Memory entry. |

### `memory.core.config.dreaming`

Dreaming flags are documented here as configuration because they are part of
the public config surface.

| Field | Type | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory.core.config.dreaming.enabled` | boolean | effective `false` | Enables dreaming status for Core Memory. |
| `memory.core.config.dreaming.frequency` | string | effective `manual` | Labels the intended dreaming cadence. |

Important note:

- the dreaming flags mirror documented memory-core state
- consolidation work is surfaced through memory tooling and governance flows
- if `frequency` is omitted, the status surface reports `manual`
